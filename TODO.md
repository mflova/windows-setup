# TODO

- Testing:
  - Run current file with neotest (leader tt) does not work
- Coding:
  - Improve visibility of files (file explorer, <leader><leader>... Since way too many files are hidden)
  - Copy affects outside
  - Configre Python runners (?)
- Debugging
  - Fix multiline output in REPL problem. Makes it impossible to debug with dataframes or numpy arrays
